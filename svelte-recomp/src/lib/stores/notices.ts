// In-app problem log.
//
// WHY: nearly every failure path in this app was `console.warn`. On a phone
// there is no console. That is the single reason "my watch workouts aren't
// syncing" went undiagnosed for so long — the app KNEW (it caught the error,
// logged it, and carried on) and had no way to tell anyone. Silent degradation
// reads to a user as "the app is lying to me", which is worse than an error.
//
// This is deliberately a ring buffer in memory, not a table: the point is to
// answer "what just went wrong?" while it is still relevant, not to build an
// analytics pipeline. Nothing leaves the device.
