// Bringing someone else in — the one thing this app has never allowed.
//
// RecompOS is entirely single-player. There is no partner view, no coach, no way
// to tell anyone how the week went short of a screenshot. That matters because
// accountability is one of the few interventions with real evidence behind it,
// and because the person doing this is usually not doing it in isolation.
//
// What this does NOT do is build a sharing PLATFORM. No new table, no share
// links, no cross-account reads, no relaxing of the row-level security that was
// audited watertight — punching a hole in that to send someone a weight number
// would be a terrible trade. It formats the week as plain text and hands it to
// the OS share sheet, so the user picks the recipient and the app never learns
// who it was. Nothing leaves the device unless a human taps send.
